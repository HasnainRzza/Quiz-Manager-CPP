# Computer Hardware Components Hierarchy

This project is an assignment for the CS-1004 Object Oriented Programming course at the National University of Computer & Emerging Sciences, Islamabad Campus. It involves creating a hierarchy of classes related to computer hardware components and implementing them in C++.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `users.cpp`: Handles user-related functionalities.
- `teacher_student.cpp`: Manages teacher and student interactions.
- `RUN.cpp`: Main file to run the application.
- `Quiz.cpp`: Manages quiz functionalities.
- `login.cpp`: Handles user login functionalities.
- `insights.cpp`: Provides insights based on data.
- `course_reg.cpp`: Manages course registration processes.

## Features

- Object-oriented design using inheritance and polymorphism.
- Detailed UML diagram to illustrate the class hierarchy.
- Commented code for better understanding and readability.
- No usage of built-in libraries, adhering to assignment guidelines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Visual Studio or any C++ IDE

### Compilation

To compile the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
g++ -o main RUN.cpp users.cpp teacher_student.cpp Quiz.cpp login.cpp insights.cpp course_reg.cpp
